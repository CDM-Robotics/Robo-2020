 * THis graphic represents the Robot's position on an XY coordinate
 * plane, where X is the axis parrallel to the long edge of the field and Y is
 * the axis parrellel to the driver station walls. Zero on the X axis is the
 * line perpendicular from the center of the driver station wall, while Zero on
 * the Y axis is one of the Driver station wall.

 The positive side of the Y axis is based on the starting direction of the Robot's Navx.  Therefore
 the Right side of the robot will always be the positive Y axis side while left will always be the negative Y axis side.
